    Windows Forms switchboard component for user interface commands with design time support.
    I have always found the command update an execution architecture in MFC not very easy to use.
    Despite all the good parts of Windows Forms, it is still missing this architecture; 
    an easily isolated mechanism for updating menus and toolbars based on application state. 
    I also wanted to research design-time support in Windows Forms, to see what is possible. 
    So, I wrote this switchboard to provide a similar functionality in Windows Forms.
