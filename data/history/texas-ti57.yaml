description: This was the first programmable device I used about 1980. I bought it myself for hard earned money. I used it for solving equations numerically while I struggled with the symbolic solution. When I found a solution then I could compare it with the numeric solution as a quality check. The calculator used about 10 minutes I think for the calculation.
