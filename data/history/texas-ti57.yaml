    This was the first programmable device I used. I bought it myself for hard earned money.    
    I used it for solving equations numerically while I struggled with the symbolic solution.
    When I found a solution then I could compare it with the numeric solution as a quality check. 
    The calculator used about 10 minutes I think for the calculation.
