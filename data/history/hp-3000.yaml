    When starting my higher education in 1983 at Kongsberg University College, 
    we used a HP 3000 computer with various terminals to program in pascal. 
    We had one graphical terminal capable of displaying graphics and I made a three dimensional 
    maze game where you could walk around a random maze to find the exit. 
    The programming language we used was Pascal.
