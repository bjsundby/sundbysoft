    It was decided that we should move to workstations and the Apollo system was selected. 
    This was a fantastic system and way ahead other systems of the same type. 
    Sadly they didn't succeed economically and was soon purchased by HP.
    We used the Apollo's Unix operating system which also emulated the other unix systems available at that time.
