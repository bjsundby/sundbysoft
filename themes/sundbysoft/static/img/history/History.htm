                <h3>Texas TI57</h3>
                This was the first programmable device
                I used
                about 1980. I bought it myself for hard earned money. I used it for solving
                equations numerically while I struggled with the symbolic solution. When I found
                a solution then I could compare it with the numeric solution as a quality check.
                The calculator used about 10 minutes I think for the calculation.

                <h3>Apple Europlus II</h3>
                This was the first real computer I used to program with. The one I used had only
                a cassette player for storing programs and a kind of tinn foil printer using
                heat to produce print. We had a star wars game using pads to control x fighters
                shooting each other. The first real program I made was a hang glider graphical
                game where you had to mainatin correct speed to stay up in the air as long as
                possible and also random bursts of rising air to get you up. You had to land in
                a correct way get a good score.<br />
                <br />
                It was programmed in basic and it was a real challenge to get i running fast
                enough.

                <h3>HP 3000</h3>
                When starting my higher education in 1984 at Kongsberg University College, we
                used a HP 3000 computer with various terminals to program in pascal. We had one
                graphical terminal capable of displaying graphics and I made a three dimensional
                maze game where you could walk around a random maze to find the exit.

                <h3>Seequa Chameleon</h3>
                I have been flying hang gliders for some years when I got a request for making a
                computer program to keep track of all results in the 1984 open european hang
                gliding championship. I made the program on this computer in JRT pascal. The
                computer was quite special in that it had both a Z80 and a 8088 microprocessor.
                It could run both MS-DOS and CP/M. It also had the nice feature that it rebooted
                if you was a little bit static and produced a small spark.<br />
                The Pascal also had a nice feature; it rebooted the computer when a division by
                zero occured. I found out that the second day into the championship when the
                computer rebooted in the middle of the result computation.

                <h3>Commodore PC</h3>
                In my third year of my education I was able to buy this computer which was a
                real PC. It had two 360K floppies but only 256K with memory. It turned out that
                a memory kit up to 512K had a cost of 1/4 of the computer price (which also was
                expensive) and it included a memory adressing PAL. We figured out how to program
                the PAL ourselves and could then buy memory chips for about 1/20 of the price
                from Commodore. We then got 640K memory which was huge at that time. I later
                bought an extension card with 1MB and with some trick extended the useable
                memory to 720K without special software.<br />
                This computer had only text display, but I bougth later a graphical black and
                white CGA graphical card and a mouse. Finally I bought a new color monitor and
                an EGA graphic card. With this hardware then mandelbrot and julia pictures was
                generated at a rate of 1 per day. When I could afford an 8087 mathematical
                coprocessor chip. I rewrote the mandelbrot generation loop in 8087 assembler and
                the generation time went down to about 5 minutes.

                I started at Strathclyde university in Glasgow in 1986. We used terminals
                connected to a unix based mainframe and IBM PC&#39;s for programming. I mainly used
                my commodore pc for all programming. But some exercise such as Cobol programmig
                had to be done on the mainframe.

                In my first work position after school we use Tandberg terminals connected to
                VAX computers. I programmed in C. In the start I had to share the terminal with
                another programmer. I was happy when I got my own terminal.
